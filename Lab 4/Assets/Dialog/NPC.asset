  dialogue:
  - Why are you throwing rocks? You might as well just not.
  - Seriously, why would you throw all these rocks away?
  - All right buddy, you seriously need to stop.
  - Please stop, we are running out of rocks.
  - STOP THROWING ROCKS!!!
  - STOP STOP STOP!!!
  - These rocks are important! Stop throwing them!
  - I am going to call the police!
  - You are stealing all my rocks! They are all I have left in this world!
  - You STUPID kid! Stop throwing rocks!
  - Please! I don't know what I'll do if you throw even one more rock!
  - What would your parents think?
  - They will be so upset with you if they hear about this.
  - Stop! Just think about your poor mother!
  - Please, just imagine her grief at knowing her child is a rock throwing delinquent!
  - Do you care for your parents at all? Do you have a care in the world for anybody
    in your life?
  - 'Wow, you''re just still throwing rocks. '
  - You really don't give a damn, huh.
  - Earlier, I made an empty threat about calling the cops. You're pushing me to
    making that a reality.
  - Hey. Kid, what the hell is your damage?
  - Are you enjoying this?
  - Do you think...
  - Throwing rocks is fun?
  - Kid, you just might be onto something.
  - Wow, just watch that rock fly!
  - I've never seen a rock embody the spirit of a bird like that.
  - You really have a knack for this! Throw some more!
  - Wow! Did you see that? That rock sure was in the air!
  - You know, all this rock throwing reminds me of something I learned when I was
    your age.
  - I used to think life was all about having stuff.
  - I spent all of my time trying to gain stuff, it was the only thing that kept
    me going.
  - I never realized it, but spending all of my time trying to get stuff meant I
    had no time to really live.
  - But then, one day, when I was feeling down, a close friend took me on a night
    out.
  - I realized life wasn't about all that. It's about going out to the club and spending
    a couple dollars on a cocktail.
  - That night, I learned life is about having fun! it's about partying! it's about
    throwing rocks...
  - Your rock throwing, it reminds me...
  - I forgot the lesson I learned all those years ago.
  - I fell into that old pattern. I forgot to throw the rocks I accumulated. I was
    accumulating them for nothing.
  - You've reminded me, that all these rocks are good for, is for what you're doing.
  - Thanks, kid. You've set my life right again.
  - Enjoy your rock throwing, when you're all out of rocks, I'll go get some more,
    and I'll join you next time.
